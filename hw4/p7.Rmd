# Overview

Cell2Cell, a wireless telecommunications company (with its name altered
for confidentiality), is working to reduce customer churn. The objective
of this project is to create a model that predicts customer churn at
Cell2Cell and to leverage insights from the model to design a targeted
incentive strategy aimed at decreasing churn rates.

In the assignment, you will address these key issues:

1.  Is customer churn at Cell2Cell predictable from the customer
    information that Cell2Cell maintains?

2.  What factors drive customer churn? Which factors are particularly
    important?

3.  What incentives should Cell2Cell offer to prevent customer churn?

4.  What is the economic value of a proposed targeted plan to prevent
    churn, and how does this value differ across customer segments?
    Compare the economic value to an incentive with a cost of \$100 and
    another incentive with a cost of \$175. Which customers segments
    should receive the incentive? Does the answer depend on the success
    probability?

Note that, in what follows, the key steps you need to take are
highlighted in *italic*.

# Data

All data are contained in the file `Cell2Cell.RData`, which is posted on
Canvas.

```{r}
data_folder    = "./Data"
Cell2Cell = "Cell2Cell.RData"
load(paste0(data_folder, "/", Cell2Cell))
```

\medskip

Please consult the file `Cell2Cell-Database-Documentation.xlsx` for a
description of the data and some summary statistics. Note that
*calibration sample* is an alternative term for *training* or
*estimation* sample.

*Report the churn rate in the calibration sample and in the validation
sample and compare the two.*

```{r}
# str(cell2cell_DT)

calibration_sample <- subset(cell2cell_DT, calibrat == 1)
validation_sample <- subset(cell2cell_DT, calibrat == 0)

# Calculate churn rate in the calibration sample
calibration_churn_rate <- mean(calibration_sample$churn)
cat("Churn Rate in Calibration Sample:", calibration_churn_rate, "\n")

# Calculate churn rate in the validation sample
validation_churn_rate <- mean(validation_sample$churn)
cat("Churn Rate in Validation Sample:", validation_churn_rate, "\n")

# Compare churn rates
if (calibration_churn_rate > validation_churn_rate) {
  cat("The churn rate is higher in the calibration sample.\n")
} else if (calibration_churn_rate < validation_churn_rate) {
  cat("The churn rate is higher in the validation sample.\n")
} else {
  cat("The churn rates are the same in both samples.\n")
}
```

You can see that the calibration sample was selected using
*oversampling*. The purpose of oversampling was to obtain more precise
estimates (lower standard errors) when estimating a logistic regression
model. The validation sample, on the other hand, was not created using
oversampling and represents the *true churn rate* in the data.

As you can see, some variables have missing values, which---as you know
by now---is common and of no concern (unless the missing values indicate
some *systematic* flaws or bias in how the data were constructed). Most
estimation methods in R will automatically delete rows with missing
values before estimating the model. However, the `predict` methods will
yield `NA` values if a row in the data used for prediction contains
missing values. Hence, in a situation where you don't need to keep the
full data I recommend to remove any observations with missing values
before you conduct the main analysis.

*Perform this data-cleaning step.*

```{r}
# Remove rows with missing values from the data
cell2cell_clean <- na.omit(cell2cell_DT)

# Verify that missing values have been removed
print(sprintf("Original dataset had %d rows", nrow(cell2cell_DT)))
print(sprintf("Cleaned dataset has %d rows", nrow(cell2cell_clean)))
print(sprintf("Removed %d rows with missing values", nrow(cell2cell_DT) - nrow(cell2cell_clean)))

```

\newpage

# Model estimation

*Estimate a logit model to predict the conditional churn probability.*

```{r}
# Fit the logistic regression model
fit <- glm(churn ~ ., 
             data = cell2cell_clean[, .SD, .SDcols = !c("customer", "calibrat")], 
             family = binomial())
```

You can inspect the regression output using methods you already used,
such as `summary`. Having said this, especially when you have a large
number of inputs, it can be convenient to store the regression estimates
in a table. A simple way to do this is to install the [broom
package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/broom/vignettes/broom.html)
that has the purpose of cleaning up messy R output.

Using the `tidy` function in the `broom` package it is trivial to
capture the regression output in the form of a data.table:

```{r}
# Tidy the model output and convert to data.table
results_DT <- as.data.table(tidy(fit))

# Display the regression results with 5 decimal places
kable(results_DT, digits = 5)

```

For `kable` to work, you need to load the `knitr` library.

# Prediction: Accounting for oversampling

The idea of oversampling is as follows. If the response rate in the data
is small, there is a strong imbalance between observations with a
response of $Y=1$ and a response of $Y=0$. As a consequence, estimating
the model is difficult and the estimates will be imprecise, i.e. they
will have large standard errors.

The solution: Create a training sample with one half of observations
randomly chosen from the original data with response $Y=1$, and the
other half randomly chosen from the original data with response $Y=0$.
Now estimation is easier and the standard errors will be smaller.

However, when applied to logistic regression, oversampling will result
in an inconsistent estimate of the intercept (constant) term, although
all other estimates will be consistent. Hence, if we do not de-bias
(adjust) the intercept, the predicted probabilities will be too large,
reflecting the artificial response rate of $\frac{1}{2}$ in the
over-sampled training data.

In order to de-bias the scale of the predicted response (in this
example: churn) in the validation sample we need to supply an *offset
variable* to the logistic regression model. An offset is a known number
that is added to the right-hand side of the regression when estimating
the model, and adding the offset will correspondingly change the
estimate of the intercept. The offset takes the form:
$$\text{offset}=\left[\log(\bar{p}_{t})-\log(1-\bar{p}_{t})\right]-\left[\log(\bar{p}_{v})-\log(1-\bar{p}_{v})\right]$$

Here, $\bar{p}_{t}$ is the average response rate in the training sample
and $\bar{p}_{v}$ is the average response rate in the validation sample.
Note that the offset is positive (given that $\bar{p}_t > \bar{p}_v$),
so that including the offset term when estimating the model accounts for
the fact that the training sample has a higher share of $Y=1$ relative
to the validation sample.

Conversely, when we predict the response rate in the validation sample,
we set the offset variable to 0.

Why does this work? --- Conceptually, logistic regression is a
regression model for the log-odds of the response (outcome) probability,
$$\log \left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) = \log(p) - \log(1-p) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_1 + \dots $$

When we add the offset variable to the right hand side of the regression
model the estimation algorithm will "incorporate" the offset in the
intercept, $\beta_0$. The effect of setting the offset to 0 (when
applying the model to the validation sample) is equivalent to
subtracting the offset from the intercept. Subtracting the offset
amounts to:

(i) Subtracting $\log(\bar{p}_{t})-\log(1-\bar{p}_{t})$, the log-odds of
    the artificial response rate in the training sample, and

(ii) Adding $\log(\bar{p}_{v})-\log(1-\bar{p}_{v})$, the log-odds in the
     validation sample that reflects the true log-odds in the data.

This process de-biases the predicted response, i.e. restores the correct
response level in the validation sample.

Note: Never use over-sampling to create the validation sample, otherwise
the offset variable approach will not work.

\bigskip

*Create an `offset_var` variable and add it to the data set. Then
re-estimate the logistic regression. To tell `glm` that you want to use
`offset_var`, you need to use a formula of the form:*

```{r, eval=FALSE}
y ~ offset(offset_var) + <all other variables>
```

```{r}
# Oversampling Bias: Helps in training but inflates the response rate, requiring adjustment.
# Offset Variable: Corrects the intercept to align predictions with the true response rate.
# Validation Data: Always use non-oversampled data for evaluation and prediction.

# Separate calibration and validation samples
calibration_sample <- subset(cell2cell_clean, calibrat == 1)
validation_sample <- subset(cell2cell_clean, calibrat == 0)

# Calculate the average churn rates in each sample
pt <- mean(calibration_sample$churn)
pv <- mean(validation_sample$churn)

# Calculate the offset variable
offset_var <- (log(pt) - log(1 - pt)) - (log(pv) - log(1 - pv))

# Add the offset variable to the calibration sample
calibration_sample$offset_var <- offset_var

```

```{r}
# Fit the logistic regression model with the offset
fit_with_offset <- glm(churn ~ . + offset(offset_var), 
                       data = calibration_sample[, .SD, .SDcols = !c("customer", "calibrat")],
                       family = binomial)

# View the summary of the model
summary(fit_with_offset)

```

*Where* you place `offset()` on the right-hand side of the formula is
irrelevant.

\medskip

*Before predicting the response rate in the validation sample set the
offset to 0. Then, when you invoke the `predict` function, supply the
data with the offset set to 0 using the `newdata` option.*

```{r}
# Add offset_var as 0 in the validation sample
validation_sample$offset_var <- 0

# Predict churn probabilities in the validation sample with offset set to 0
validation_sample$predicted_churn <- predict(
  fit_with_offset,
  newdata = validation_sample[, .SD, .SDcols = !c("customer","calibrat")],
  type = "response")
```

*Compare the average predicted response with the average observed
response rate in the validation sample.*

```{r}
# Calculate the average predicted churn rate
average_predicted_churn <- mean(validation_sample$predicted_churn)

# Calculate the observed churn rate in the validation sample
average_observed_churn <- mean(validation_sample$churn)

# Display the results
cat("Average Predicted Churn Rate in Validation Sample:", average_predicted_churn, "\n")
cat("Average Observed Churn Rate in Validation Sample:", average_observed_churn, "\n")
cat("Average of predicted churn rate and the actual churn rate are close after \
    de-biasing with the offset varaible. This indicates that the model's \
    predictions are correctly calibrated to reflect the real-world churn rate. \n")
```

\newpage

# Predictive power: Lift

We evaluate the predictive fit of the logistic regression model using a
lift table and lift chart. To develop reusable code, we develop a
function that returns a lift table. The function (call it `liftTable`)
will need to take the following inputs:

-   Predicted outcome or score
-   Observed outcome
-   Number of segments to be created based on the score

`liftTable` will return a data.table that contains:

-   An index (`score_group`) for each segment that was created based on
    the score
-   The average score value (predicted outcome) in the `score_group`
-   The average observed outcome in the `score_group`
-   The lift factor

\bigskip

To code the `liftTable` command, I recommend to use the `cut_number`
function in the ggplot2 package. `cut_number` takes a variable `x` and
creates `n` groups with an approximately equal number of observations in
each group. Observations are assigned to the groups based on their
ranking along the variable `x`. The format is:

```         
cut_number(x, n = <no. of groups>)
```

\medskip

To illustrate, we draw 10,000 random numbers from a uniform distribution
on $[0,5]$. `cut_number` assigns each number to one of five (because we
set `n = 5`) groups.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
DT = data.table(x = runif(10000, min = 0, max = 5))
DT[, group    := cut_number(x, n = 5)]
DT[, group_no := as.integer(group)]
```

```{r}
head(DT)
table(DT$group)
```

\medskip

As expected, because `x` is uniformly distributed on $[0,5]$, the five
groups created by `cut_number` correspond almost exactly to a $[k,k+1]$
interval ($k=0,1,\dots,4$), and each of these intervals contains exactly
20 percent of all observations based on the rank of the `x` values. The
`group` variable that we created is a factor that we converted to an
integer score.

\bigskip

*Calculate a lift table for 20 segments. Inspect the lift table. Then
provide two charts. First, plot the `score_group` segments on the x-axis
versus the observed churn rate on the y-axis. Second, plot the segments
versus the lift factor, and add a horizontal line at* $y=100$. How to do
this in ggplot2 is explained in the ggplot2 guide (look for the
`yintercept` option).

```{r}
liftTable <- function(predicted, observed, segments = 20) {
  # Combine inputs into a data.table
  DT <- data.table(predicted = predicted, observed = observed)
  
  # Create score groups using cut_number
  DT[, score_group := as.integer(cut_number(predicted, n = segments))]
  
  # Calculate lift table metrics
  lift_table <- DT[, .(
    avg_score = mean(predicted),
    avg_observed = mean(observed),
    lift_factor = mean(observed) / mean(DT$observed) * 100
  ), by = score_group]
  
  return(lift_table)
}

# Apply the liftTable function
lift_table <- liftTable(
  predicted = validation_sample$predicted_churn,
  observed = validation_sample$churn,
  segments = 20
)

# Inspect the lift table
print(lift_table)

#  Churn Rate vs. Score Groups
# Higher score groups (with higher predicted churn probabilities) should have higher
# observed churn rates.
ggplot(lift_table, aes(x = score_group, y = avg_observed)) +
  geom_line(color = "steelblue", linewidth = 1) +  # Use `linewidth` for line width
  geom_point(color = "steelblue", size = 2) +  # Points on the line
  labs(
    title = "Observed Churn Rate by Score Group",
    x = "Score Group",
    y = "Observed Churn Rate"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Lift Factor vs. Score Groups
# The lift factor should be highest for the top score groups (high-risk churners).
# The horizontal line at y = 100 represents the baseline (random guessing or avg churn rate). 
# It hits close to the mid segment group reflects that the churn predictions align 
# with the reality (observation) of churn that is expected per each segment.
ggplot(lift_table, aes(x = score_group, y = lift_factor)) +
  geom_line(color = "darkorange", linewidth = 1) +  # Use `linewidth` for line width
  geom_point(color = "darkorange", size = 2) +  # Points on the line
  geom_hline(yintercept = 100, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +  # Horizontal reference line
  labs(
    title = "Lift Factor by Score Group",
    x = "Score Group",
    y = "Lift Factor"
  ) +

# Why do customers churn? --- Effect sizes

We would like to understand *why* customers churn, which can help us to
propose incentives to prevent customer churn

*To this end, construct a table that contains comparable effect sizes
(changes in the churn probability) for all independent variables, as we
discussed in class.*

Here are a few more details on the steps needed to create this table:

1.  Because logistic regression coefficients are not directly
    interpretable, we estimate a linear probability model of customer
    churn. In a linear probability model we regress the $Y=0,1$ output
    on all the customer features. The estimated coefficients can be
    interpreted as differences in $\Pr\{Y=1 | X_1, X_2, \dots\}$ for a
    one-unit difference in one of the features, $X_k$. Note: **The
    *offset variable* should not be included in the linear probability
    model as it is specific to logistic regression.**
2.  Note that our analysis is based on a *comparison* of the effect
    sizes of the different variables. However, because the variables
    have different scales, the effect sizes are not directly comparable.
    For example, `revenue` (mean monthly revenue) and `mou` (mean
    monthly minutes use) have different means and standard deviations,
    and hence the effects of increasing `revenue` and `mou` by one unit
    on the churn probabilities are not comparable without taking the
    scale differences into account.
3.  To solve this problem we **standardize** the independent variables
    in the data. To standardize, we divide the values of each
    independent variable by its standard deviation, except if the
    variable is a 0/1 dummy. Once standardized, all variables except the
    dummies will have a standard deviation of 1, and a one unit
    difference corresponds to a one standard deviation difference in the
    original, non-standardized variable. Here's a function,
    `standardize_columns`, that takes a column `x` as input and returns
    the standardized values of the column:

```{r}
standardize_columns <- function(x) {
   
   # Check if the column is a dummy variable
   elements = unique(x)
   if (length(elements) == 2L & all(elements %in% c(0L,1L))) {
      is_dummy = TRUE
   } else {
      is_dummy = FALSE
   }
   
   # If not a dummy, divide values in x by its standard deviation
   if (is_dummy == FALSE) x = x/sd(x, na.rm = TRUE)
   
   return(x)
}
```

The first part of the function checks that the input `x` has exactly two
elements and that these elements are the integers 0 and 1. Note that in
R, numbers are represented as floating point numbers by default.
However, adding `L` after the numbers tells R to represent the number as
an integer.

```{r}
class(1)
class(1L)
```

```{r}
DT_lin_prob = cell2cell_clean[calibrat == 1]

# Create a vector that contains the names of all inputs (covariates)
# remove customer, calibrat, churn columns, retcall
all_columns   = names(DT_lin_prob)
input_columns = all_columns[-c(1:3, length(all_columns))] 

# Standardize all input columns
DT_lin_prob[, (input_columns) := lapply(.SD, standardize_columns), .SDcols = input_columns]

library(tidyverse)

Dv_lin_prob = cell2cell_clean[calibrat == 0]

# Create a vector that contains the names of all inputs (covariates)
all_columns   = names(Dv_lin_prob)
input_columns = all_columns[-c(1:3, length(all_columns))]

# Standardize all input columns
Dv_lin_prob[, (input_columns) := lapply(.SD, standardize_columns), .SDcols = input_columns]

# Calculate average churn probabilities in training and validation samples
avg_churn_train <- mean(DT_lin_prob$churn)
avg_churn_valid <- mean(Dv_lin_prob$churn)

# Specify the formula excluding the first three columns
independent_vars = names(DT_lin_prob)[-(1:3)]
formula <- as.formula(paste("churn ~", paste(independent_vars, collapse = " + ")))

# Fit the lpm model
lm_model <- lm(formula, data = cell2cell_clean, family = "binomial")

# Tidy the linear probability model output
tidy_model <- tidy(lm_model)

# Add effect_size column
tidy_model <- tidy_model %>%
  mutate(effect_size = estimate * (100 * avg_churn_valid / avg_churn_train))

# Sort by absolute effect_size and print the table
tidy_model <- tidy_model %>% arrange(desc(abs(effect_size)))
kable(tidy_model)
```

4.  In order to create a table that captures the linear probability
    model estimates, use the `tidy` function. Add a column, e.g.
    `effect_size`, that scales the estimates by the factor
    $$100 \cdot \frac{\bar{p}_{v}}{\bar{p}_{t}}$$ This scales the effect
    sizes to the correct magnitude of the churn probabilities in the
    validation sample and puts the effects on a 0-100% scale. Sort the
    variables according to the magnitude of the effect sizes, and print
    the results table using `kable`.
5.  Inspect the results. Identify some factors that are strongly
    associated with churn. If actionable, propose an incentive that can
    be targeted to the customers to prevent churn.

```{r}
sorted_model <- tidy_model %>% arrange(desc(effect_size))
top_5 <- head(sorted_model, 5)
bottom_5 <- tail(sorted_model, 5)

print(top_5)
print(bottom_5)

```

Factors that are strongly associated with churn.

**Strong positively churn**

Assuming p\<0.05 is statistically significant

1.  retcall (0.55341249) : Customers with retention calls are more
    likely to churn, possibly due to dissatisfaction with previous
    interactions or unresolved issues. Highly significant (p=1.89e-05)

    Incentive :

    -   Personalized Service Recovery: Provide dedicated, high-quality
        customer service follow-ups for customers who have made a
        retention call, ensuring their issues are fully resolved. -
        Offer discounts or credits (e.g., one-time \$50 credit) for the
        inconvenience.

2.  refurb (0.19258463) : Customers with refurbished devices are more
    likely to churn, possibly due to dissatisfaction with older
    hardware. Highly significant(p=3.87e10-21)

    Incentive :

    -   Upgrade Program : Create trade-in programs allowing refurbished
        users to easily swap for newer models at minimal cost.

Note : retcalls frequency (0.16922533) and occhmkr (0.09912475) has high
magnitude but not statistically significant p \> 0.05.

**Strong negatively churn (unlikely to churn)**

1.  creditaa (-0.2891994) : Customers with excellent credit ratings 'aa'
    are less likely to churn, possibly indicating higher satisfaction or
    loyalty.

    Incentive :

    -   Offer loyalty programs, such as discounts on premium services or
        free upgrades, for customers who meet certain payment and credit
        score thresholds.

2.  retaccpt (-0.1760470) : Customers who accept retention offers are
    less likely to churn, highlighting the effectiveness of these
    interventions.

    Incentive :

    -   Post retention engagement : Provide incentives for continued
        loyalty, such as bonus points or exclusive access to new
        features.

<!-- -->

3.  credita (-0.1450354) : Customers with excellent credit ratings 'a'
    are less likely to churn. Similar to creditaa.

    Incentive :

    -   Send message to encourage them to earn more points to move to
        the 'aa' tier.

# Economics of churn management

Next, we would like to predict the value of a proposed churn management
program in order to assess the maximum amount that we would spend to
prevent a customer from churning for one year.

*Perform this prediction*, under the following assumptions:

1.  We consider a planning horizon of 4 years (the current year and
    three additional years), and an annual discount rate of 8 percent.
2.  Predict the churn management value for 20 groups, but keep in mind
    that it is good practice to make sure the code works for an
    arbitrary number of groups in case we wish to modify that in the
    future. Predict the program value for these 20 customer segments
    based on the predicted churn rate. Note that we create these
    segments based on the validation sample data. We predict current and
    future customer profits at the year-level. Hence, we also need to
    convert both the monthly churn rate and the revenue data to the
    year-level.
3.  Assume that the churn management program has a success probability
    `gamma` ($\gamma$) and compare the results for $\gamma=0.25$ and
    $\gamma=0.5$.

\medskip

Hint: It is easy to make little mistakes in the lifetime value
predictions. Hence, be very clear about what your code is supposed to
achieve, and check that every step is correct.

```{r}
# Program Value 
# Gamma = 0.25 : Success probability 25%. Churn with Incentive is 75%.
# Gamma = 0.50 : Success probability 50%. Churn with Incentive is 50%.

Analyzing Result :

Value of a proposed churn management program (WTP) Per segment

-   WTP_0.25 is the value of a proposed churn management program that
    has 0.25 success value.

-   For example, for score group 20, we can spend up to \$105.96373 per
    customer per 4 year, assuming a 25% success probability (𝛾= 0.25 ).

-   WTP_0.5 is the value of a proposed churn management program that has
    0.5 success value.

-   For example, for score group 20, we can spend up to \$580.1549 per
    customer per 4 year, assuming a 50% success probability (𝛾= 0.5 ).

Maximum amount that we would spend to prevent a customer from churning
for one year.

-   Max WTP per 1 year, is the WTP after applying the program for Y0 -\>
    Y1. After then the churn will go from 0 -\> 1 (retention). Even if
    the program makes customer stays as long as 4 years. We'll only
    consider that we spent \$100 program cost on the first year.

-   So the Max WTP per 1 year is WTP_0.25 and WTP_0.5

# Summarize your main results

*Please organize your main results along the four questions posed in the
overview.*

1.  Is customer churn at Cell2Cell predictable from the customer
    information that Cell2Cell maintains?

    Yes, customer churn at Cell2Cell is predictable using the customer
    data provided.

    -   Predictive Performance: The logistic regression model
        successfully predicts churn with close alignment between the
        average predicted churn rate (0.0194) and the observed churn
        rate (0.0193) in the validation sample after adjusting for
        oversampling.

    -   Lift Analysis: The model demonstrates strong predictive power
        through lift analysis, where higher score groups exhibit
        significantly higher churn rates compared to lower groups,
        confirming the model's ability to rank customers by churn risk.
        Additionally, when applied the baseline churn rate, It hits
        close to the mid segment group reflects that the churn
        'predictions' align with the 'observation' of churn – the
        reality that is expected per each segment.

2.  What factors drive customer churn? Which factors are particularly
    important?

    See also part 6 analysis,

    1.  retcall (0.55341249) : Customers with retention calls are more
        likely to churn, possibly due to dissatisfaction with previous
        interactions or unresolved issues. Highly significant
        (effect_size=0.55341249 , p=1.89e-05)

    2.  creditaa (-0.2891994) : Customers with excellent credit ratings
        'aa' are less likely to churn, possibly indicating higher
        satisfaction or loyalty. Highly significant
        (effect_size=-0.2891994 , p=3.96e-43)

    3.  refurb (0.19258463) : Customers with refurbished devices are
        more likely to churn, possibly due to dissatisfaction with older
        hardware. Highly significant (effect_size=0.19258463,
        p=3.88e-21)

3.  What incentives should Cell2Cell offer to prevent customer churn?

See also part 6 analysis,

-   Personalized Service Recovery: Provide dedicated, high-quality
    customer service follow-ups for customers who have made a retention
    call, ensuring their issues are fully resolved. - Offer discounts or
    credits (e.g., one-time \$50 credit) for the inconvenience.

-   Implement a proactive monitoring system to identify frequent
    retention team callers and address their issues before they
    escalate.

-   Provide special discounts or perks (e.g., reduced fees for 3 months)
    to frequent retention callers to demonstrate appreciation and regain
    trust.

-   Upgrade Program : Create trade-in programs allowing refurbished
    users to easily swap for newer models at minimal cost.

-   Offer loyalty programs, such as discounts on premium services or
    free upgrades, for customers who meet certain payment and credit
    score thresholds. This will incentivize 'aa' credit customer to stay
    loyal.

4.  What is the economic value of a proposed targeted plan to prevent
    churn, and how does this value differ across customer segments?
    Compare the economic value to an incentive with a cost of \$100 and
    another incentive with a cost of \$175. Which customers segments
    should receive the incentive? Does the answer depend on the success
    probability?

    -   Customer in segment 20 (high churn rate) provides higher benefit
        from churn management program than customer in segment 1 (low
        churn rate). This is because if we apply the program to the
        group that is likely to churn, we can gain the benefit from the
        customer that continue to stay with us.
    -   Cost of the incentive is \$100,
        -   If the program has 0.25 success rate, Cell2Cell will earn
            profit if apply program to segment 2-19. The segment 1 shown
            -\$0.4843072, suggesting that the program cost is higher
            than the value that churn program will give. Hence, it is
            not worth investing in segment 1.
        -   If the program has 0.5 success rate, Cell2Cell can earn
            profit from all segments.
    -   Cost of the incentive is \$175,
        -   If the program has 0.25 success rate, Cell2Cell should
            target only 19-20th segments because they offer profit.
        -   If the program has 0.5 success rate, Cell2Cell can target
            all segments.
    -   To be the most effective, Cell2Cell should target the customer
        with higher churn rate like 20th segments if the likelihood of
        program success is low (0.25) and program cost is between
        \$100-175. However, if the likelihood of program success is high
        (0.50) it can target any segments given the cost of implementing
        program is between \$100-175.
